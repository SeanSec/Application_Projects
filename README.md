# Application_Projects
I'm Sean Cobb, this is a repository I've created for my resume. This repository contains projects I did while attending Colorado State University. I add to this frequently and this README will give a brief summary of the projects, my role, my work, and the results. Any potential employers should read the summaries contained in this document to understand the purpose behind these projects.

## AI_Final
This is a project done by my partner Gabe Knudston and I. The goal of our project was to create 3 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that could overcome the inefficiency of CNNs and classify code comments in the Java, Python, and Pharo coding languages. We wanted to minimize the amount of Floating-Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS), for the purpose of measuring our models efficiency. This project was created for the Natural Language-based Software Engineering 2025 International Workshop. Our file contains our Jupyter notebook containing our model and measurements, and a PDF report on our model.

### Personal Work
I was resopnsible for the creation, testing, and scoring of the models. I was also responsible for half of the report.

## cs457_proj
This was my final project done in my Networking class at CSU with my two partners Seth Harling, and Jared Traub. We were tasked with creating a server-client based game using the Scrum Application Development Methodology. We created a 3 player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The description, breakdown, protocols, and how to play of the game is summarized in the README contained within the project folder.

### Personal Work
I was responsible for the security measures present in our project (which were not required, but extra credit). This includes Creation of a self-signed certificate and private key, encrypted connection using an SSL wrapped socket, and input validation. I would like to state, the private key and certificate are located in a public folder because our Professor required this for key and certificate validation on his end. I was also responsible for the underlying mechanics and protocols that enabled gameplay.

## Machine_Learning_Final
This was my final project done in my Machine Learning class at CSU with my partner Gabe Knudston. We were tasked with using common Machine Learning methodologies to create two machine learning-based models that would act as predictive models for a dataset.We aimed to develop two predictive machine learning-based models for predicting New York housing prices found in a dataset on Kaggle.

### Personal Work
I was responsible for half of the data cleanup, data visualization, and the development of a Random Forest Regressor Model. The specifics of my contributions are available at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook.

## Malware_Detection_Machine_Learning
This was a project done in my Modern Security class at CSU done by only me. I was tasked with building a Random Forest Classifier, K-Neighbor Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier, K-Means Clustering model, and Gaussian Mixture Clustering model for identifying malware. Malware characteristics were compiled in a dataset on Kaggle. All conclusions/results are avialable within the Jupyter Notebook.
